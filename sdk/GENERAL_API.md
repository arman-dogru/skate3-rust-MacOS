# General engine API

Manifest API remains `2`. Feature discovery uses compiled `sdk.capabilities`:
`engine_access=1`, `command_results=1`, `native_bodies=1`,
`input_override=1`, `controllers=1`, `action_ids=1`, `player_physics=2`, `player_overlap=1`, `landed_details=1`,
`audio=4` (1: the mod's own WAVs, `sdk.audio.preload / play / update / stop / stop_all`; 2: posts to retail
classes, globals, MixMap / global watch, `sdk.audio.info`; 3: `sdk.audio.play` goes through the game's mixer by
default, with the retail emitter distance law, reverb send and panner (`native = false` keeps the Bevy voice; a
positional sound's reach defaults to 40 m squared); 4: `sdk.audio.set_mixmap_input` (drive an input of a retail
MixMap controller, e.g. the Master gains for a duck; owned, released on `nil` / stop) and `sdk.audio.seed`
(a seedable audio random state for reproducible tests)), `audio_content=3` (an `audio.json` content overlay that
replaces / adds retail audio by identity while the mod runs; 2: its `rules`; 3: content changes are swapped
into the running audio without a restart (only a MixMap or grain change restarts it), `audio.json` and its files
reload while the mod runs (the script keeps running), `add.projects` = the mod's own Csis projects), `audio_events=3`
(`sdk.audio.subscribe / events`, observe; 2: `sdk.audio.rule`, declarative mute / replace / layer rules whose
sound plays at the owner of the game's sound by default, following it; `play.at` = `owner` (with an `offset`),
`world` (a fixed `position`) or `centre`, `play.falloff` the reach; 3: `play.frame = 'owner'` puts the `offset`
in the owner's axes (right, up, facing), and a rule sound at a published emitter follows it when it moves),
`audio_tuning=1` (`sdk.audio.set_tuning / tuning / tuned`: player / world / bus / reverb tuning while the mod runs)
and `world_audio=4` (publishing cars, peds and skaters to the game's world audio; 2: `emitter` and `reverb_zone`
objects; a mod emitter has its own emitter instance by default, `settings/audio.json` `"mod_emitter_slots":
"shared"` makes it share retail's 5 with the map's emitters; 3: `slots = 'own'` gives a car or ped its own
MixMap instance instead of retail's pools; 4: that is the default for a mod's cars and peds, as for its emitters:
the 16 nearest own cars / 16 nearest own peds (all mods) within retail's list radii play, a farther one waits
(`read(key).waiting`) and is never refused or moved into retail's pools; `slots = 'shared'` (alias `retail`,
accepted by 3 too) puts one in retail's pools with the map's objects; `read(key).slots`, `info().own`); all declared in `skate.lua`, reference in `docs/hails-additions/16-audio-modding.md`.
The host has no injury, vehicle or challenge rules. Those live in Lua.

`deformation=1` adds optional impact-driven mesh/collider deformation.
See [DEFORMATION.md](DEFORMATION.md) for generic body parameters, scene-node
bindings, performance limits and multiplayer behavior.

## Reading systems

`sdk.engine.systems()` lists available system names. `sdk.engine.read(name)`
reads the latest snapshot, without executing a new simulation step:

| Name | Data | Write interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| player | Mode, bail, stance, pose, velocity, scoring and transition counters | Existing player teleport, participation, attachment and gesture controls |
| rig | Native bodies, anatomical joints, solver contacts and joint loads | `sdk.rig`, typed `sdk.bodies` impulses |
| bodies | This mod's Rapier bodies and contacts | `sdk.physics` creation, geometry, forces, velocities, transforms, joints and motors |
| input | Raw pad, keys, 18 mapped action values and controller identity | `sdk.input.override_action` |
| graphs | Live action/motion controller states, state times and active behavior IDs | `sdk.graphs.set_enabled` |
| animation | Tick, pose generation and bone count | No arbitrary animation replacement or pose injection |
| scoring | Current player scoring observations | No arbitrary native score/collector mutation |
| world | Current map observation | Existing mod geometry and volume APIs; no rewriting map assets |
| triggers | Map, custom-map and mod trigger volumes; who is inside; enter/exit `on_event`s | `sdk.triggers` mod volumes, map-volume switches, tracked bodies, query-shape constants |
| camera | Current camera observation, Camera Angle (`angle`) | Existing follow, watch, mirror, rig, set, capture and release controls; `set_angle`, `tune_shot` (capability 4) |
| network | Session identity, peers and mod state | Existing state publication, entity replication and authority-controlled operations |
| commands | This mod's most recent command receipts | `sdk.commands.request` |

The existing graphics, audio, UI, settings, assets and timer interfaces remain
available. Menus can create a named pause-menu section and nested pages using
`sdk.ui.menu(key, {section=..., title=..., items=...})`.

Catalogs are larger and requested explicitly:

```lua
sdk.engine.inspect("catalog", "graphs") -- or "scoring", "audio_catalog", "audio_tuning:<domain>[/path]"
-- On a later callback:
local result = sdk.commands.result("catalog")
if result and result.ok then
    local action = result.value.action
end
```

Graph catalogs expose authored names, hierarchy, transitions, operations and
runtime behavior IDs. `states[].enabled`, `transitions[].enabled` and
`behaviors[].enabled` reflect runtime gates. `authored_enabled` and operation
metadata describe the loaded asset. Binding `states[].behaviors` uses operation
IDs; use `behaviors[].id` for behavior gates. Scoring catalogs expose loaded
definition IDs, labels, categories and authored points, not a substitute scoring
implementation.

## Commands and results

```lua
local token = sdk.commands.request("release_joint", {
    kind="player_joint", joint=joint.index,
    options={free_swing=true, free_twist=true, drive_enabled=false,
             possession_enabled=false, descendants=true}
})
-- A later snapshot, after the host executes the command:
local result = sdk.commands.result("release_joint")
if result then
    if result.ok then sdk.log("Applied") else sdk.log(result.error) end
end
```

A request wraps any validated native command table. The `kind` and payload are
the same as the public wrappers in `crates/skate-mods/src/api.lua`; the full
schema is `Command` in `crates/skate-mods/src/vm.rs`. Results contain `token`,
`ok`, `error`, `value`, and simulation `tick`. Reusing a key replaces its slot;
the Lua accessor ignores an older token. Maximum 64 result keys per mod.
Receipts remain readable until replacement or mod/world cleanup. Nested requests
are rejected. Invalid Lua/schema arguments still fail callback validation.

`ok` means the host accepted and applied that command. It does not mean a remote
peer acknowledged a network message or a multi-tick operation finished. Host
execution failures become receipts instead of disabling the mod. Commands are
not rollback transactions. Ordinary wrappers remain fire-and-forget, with their
existing error behavior. Skyline uses a receipt for chassis creation before
binding graphics, audio and driving state to that body.

## Native bodies and constraints

All native IDs are **zero-based**; Lua arrays are one-based. Discover IDs from
observations instead of assuming animation bone IDs equal physical part IDs.

Use `sdk.rig.read({"tick", "ragdoll", "contacts"})` to request only those
top-level fields. `sdk.rig.contacts()`, `parts()` and `joints()` also convert only
their requested section into Lua. Calling `sdk.rig.read()` without arguments
still returns the complete rig, including joint solver data.

```lua
local rig = sdk.rig.read()
local part = rig.parts[1]
local body = sdk.bodies.read({kind="skater", index=part.index})
sdk.bodies.impulse(body, {0,10,0}, body.position)
sdk.bodies.angular_impulse({kind="board", index=0}, {0,1,0})
sdk.bodies.impulse({kind="mod", key="crate"}, {0,10,0})
```

Native skater/board reads expose position, XYZW quaternion, world linear/angular
velocities, inverse mass/inertia and state flags. Skater parts also expose the
mapped bone name, joint index, effective collision/material/drive settings and
the direct part override. Impulse vectors use world coordinates: N s for linear,
N m s for angular; an optional world point adds the corresponding torque. Native
impulses are local-player only and rejected while attached or suspended. Commands
apply between simulation steps. Subsequent native controls and constraints still
participate. Bodies with no dynamic mass reject impulses.

`sdk.rig.configure_joint(index, options)` replaces a mod-owned override:

- `swing_limit`, `twist_limit`: radians in `[0.01, pi]`.
- `free_swing`, `free_twist`: release the corresponding angular limit.
- `enabled=false`: omit the entire joint constraint, including its linear anchor.
- `drive_enabled=false`: omit the child's animation bone drives.
- `possession_enabled=false`: omit board-holding drives involving the child.
- `descendants=true`: extend those **drive suppressions** down the physical
  joint hierarchy. Joint angle/enable changes still affect the specified joint.

Free angular limits retain linear attachment. This is what Broken Bones uses.
Native parameters and packed joint frames are readable but are not writable raw
memory. Limits apply to a temporary joint copy, so native defaults remain intact.
Drive-enable observations include ancestor and part suppression; `true` permits
native drives but does not create a drive that the current native state omits.

`sdk.rig.configure_part(index, options)` replaces a physical part override:
`motion="dynamic"|"frozen"|"static"` (native flags 4/2/1), `collision=bool`,
`friction=0..10` (both material coefficients), `animation_drives=bool`, and
`possession_drives=bool`. These affect the native solve. They do not replace the
whole player's movement state, mass preset, rendering or animation output.
Freezing a physical part does not freeze its animation target.

`reset_joint(index)` and `reset_part(index)` release owned overrides.
`sdk.rig.reset()` releases **all** this mod's joint and part overrides. Direct
joint/part slots, action slots and graph gates reject a different owner's write.
Omitted fields follow native behavior. Mod failure, disable/unload and world
changes restore owned controls. Released impulses are physical changes and are
not undone. Another mod's ancestor drive suppression can still affect a child.

## Contacts and joint loads

`sdk.rig.contacts()` reads the most recent completed native solve. `rig.tick`
is the cursor; do not count the same snapshot again in multiple callbacks.
Contacts include:

- `id`, `phase`: stable body-pair identity and `begin`, `stay`, `end`.
  Multiple manifold points share the pair lifecycle.
- `a`, `b`: board/skater body index, static world, external solid or remote actor.
  External solids include `solid_id` and, when locally known, mod `owner`/`key`.
  Remote actors include peer ID and board/skater part identity.
- World point and normal; normal/friction/total forces; impulse (`force * dt`);
  combined static/dynamic friction and material tags.
- `relative_velocity_before_solve`: A minus B velocity at the contact point,
  including angular velocity, sampled from the bodies before this solve.
  `closing_speed=max(0,-dot(relative_velocity,normal))`.

These are solver samples, not exact continuous time-of-impact measurements.
Resting support can have substantial force, so injury rules should also require
closing speed. `end` reports have zero force/impulse/velocity. At most 128 active
contact reports plus enough end reports to reach 256 are published per tick;
`contacts_truncated` signals omitted reports. Pair tracking still examines all
contacts; truncation does not create false contact ends.

Each joint's `load` is absent if no eligible row was solved. Otherwise it exposes
world linear/angular impulse and force/torque, plus the packed `solver_words`.
The host projects native accumulators (bytes 32/48) using axes at 192/240 and
divides displacement-producing corrections by dt for impulses, then dt again for
forces. Signs are for the child/A body. Angular values describe the direct
angular constraint couple, excluding the lever-arm torque from the linear anchor.
These are constraint reactions, not a bone-damage model.

Rapier `sdk.physics.read(key).player_overlapping` tests enabled native player
shapes against the body's actual collider shapes. Sensors use intersection;
solids include a 0.025 m contact tolerance. Suspended/attached players are excluded.
This differs from `sdk.volumes`, which checks observed player root positions.

## Input and graph control

`sdk.input.override_action(id, value)` overrides mapped gameplay actions 64–81
with a value in `[-1,1]`; nil releases the slot. It applies at the next input
publication and lasts until released or cleaned up. It leaves raw pad/key
observations intact and respects menu/debug input suppression.
`id` may also be a key of `sdk.input.action_ids` (`"a"`, `"left_stick_x"`, …);
`sdk.input.action(id)` reads the current value the same way.

### Gameplay action IDs

The IDs are retail Skate 3's eighteen gameplay actions, registered in this
order from the shipped `data/config/input.cfg` (the setup validates that file
against this table). Values: sticks are −1..1 after the retail dead zone (right
and up are positive); buttons are 0 or 1 (any non-zero value is pressed);
triggers are 0..1, and ground grabs, board drop/throw and the bail request need
exactly 1. The last column lists what the retail input listener publishes from
the action (its intent names); the authored action/motion graphs then decide
what that does in the current state. The main entries are checked by
`skate-core` `input::gameplay_map::tests`, which drives each ID the way an
override does and records the intents.

| ID | Key | Retail action | Expression | Xbox 360 binding | Listener intents (meaning) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 64 | `left_stick_x` | `GP_LStickX` | `LStickR-LStickL` | Left stick X | Steer (`Turn`, `HardTurn`), `KickTurn`, `BodySpin`, powerslide (`LeftSlide`/`RightSlide` beyond 0.9 deflection), grind balance (`GrindBalanceX`, `PhysGrindTranslation`), off-board walking, `WipeoutControlX` |
| 65 | `left_stick_y` | `GP_LStickY` | `LStickU-LStickD` | Left stick Y | Steering angle (with X), automatic push (profile option), off-board walking, `WipeoutControlY` |
| 66 | `left_stick_click` | `GP_LStickIn` | `LStick` | Left stick click | `WipeOutRequest` (bail) with 69 and both triggers fully pressed |
| 67 | `right_stick_x` | `GP_RStickX` | `RStickR-RStickL` | Right stick X | Flick-it trick gestures, `TweakX`, `BoardAdjustAngle`, `HandPlantTweakX`, `PhysGrindTranslation`, `OB_LookAtX`, `WipeoutGestureX` |
| 68 | `right_stick_y` | `GP_RStickY` | `RStickU-RStickD` | Right stick Y | Flick-it trick gestures, `Manual` / `ManualBrake`, `TweakY`, `HandPlantTweakY`, `PhysGrindUpDown`, `OB_LookAtY` |
| 69 | `right_stick_click` | `GP_RStickIn` | `RStick` | Right stick click | `WipeOutRequest` with 66 and both triggers; `OB_DoAirBodyTweak` |
| 70 | `left_trigger` | `GP_LTrigger` | `LTrigger` | Left trigger | `LeftAirGrab` (> 0), `LeftGroundGrab` (= 1), `Crouch`; off board a full press is `OB_DropBoard` / `OB_RetrieveBoard`; part of `WipeOutRequest` |
| 71 | `right_trigger` | `GP_RTrigger` | `RTrigger` | Right trigger | `RightAirGrab`, `RightGroundGrab`, `Crouch`; off board `OB_ThrowBoard`; `WipeOutPushOff`; part of `WipeOutRequest` |
| 72 | `left_bumper` | `GP_LBumper` | `LBumper` | Left bumper | No intent of its own: wins over RB when both are pressed together; while held it suppresses the D-pad gestures and the board toggle (79) |
| 73 | `right_bumper` | `GP_RBumper` | `RBumper` | Right bumper | `GrabWorld` (ledges, coping, handplants), `DarkCatch` / `NewDarkCatch`, `OB_DoAirBodyTweak`; suppresses D-pad gestures |
| 74 | `dpad_up` | `GP_UDPad` | `DPadU` | D-pad up | `GestureUpStart` / `GestureUpHeld` |
| 75 | `dpad_down` | `GP_DDPad` | `DPadD` | D-pad down | `GestureDownStart` / `GestureDownHeld` |
| 76 | `dpad_left` | `GP_LDPad` | `DPadL` | D-pad left | `GestureLeftStart` / `GestureLeftHeld` |
| 77 | `dpad_right` | `GP_RDPad` | `DPadR` | D-pad right | `GestureRightStart` / `GestureRightHeld` |
| 78 | `x` | `GP_XFace` | `X` | X | `LeftPush` / `NewPush` / `Pushing`, `HandPlantOneFootLeft`, `OB_Jump` (off board), `WipeOutRecover` |
| 79 | `y` | `GP_YFace` | `Y` | Y | `ToggleOffBoardState` / `NewToggleOffBoardState` (get off / back on the board) |
| 80 | `a` | `GP_AFace` | `A` | A | `RightPush` / `NewPush` / `Pushing`, `HandPlantOneFootRight`, `OB_Sprint` (off board, while B is up), `WipeOutRecover` |
| 81 | `b` | `GP_BFace` | `B` | B | `Brake`, `Dismount` / `NewDismount` (in the air the graphs choose dismount or a no-foot trick), `DarkCatch`, `HandPlantDismount`; blocks `OB_Sprint` |

The session-marker combos (LB + D-pad) and the menus read the pad directly, not
these actions. Example, a scripted ollie: `override_action('a', 1)` for 0.25 s,
then `right_stick_y` −1 for 0.35 s and +1 for 0.25 s, then release both.

### Controller identity

`sdk.input.controller(slot)` returns the identity of the controller in slot
0..3 (default: the slot gameplay reads) or nil; `sdk.input.controllers()`
returns `{active, slots}`. Fields: `family` (`xbox360`, `xbox_one`,
`xbox_elite`, `xinput_gamepad`, `playstation3/4/5`, `switch_pro`,
`joycon_left/right/pair`, `standard`, XInput subtypes such as `wheel` or
`guitar`, `unknown`), `name`, `vendor_id` / `product_id`, `backend` (`sdl` or
`xinput`), `driver` (SDL device path, e.g. `XInput#0`), `xinput_subtype` and
`wireless` (XInput only), `paddles` (reported by the driver) and
`hardware_paddles` (the model has), `touchpad`, `misc_button`, `prompt_style`
(`xbox`, `playstation`, `nintendo`), `face_labels` (printed names of the South,
East, West and North buttons) and `summary`. It is read-only and does not
change gameplay input: the button layout is positional for every pad (the
South button is always the A action, also on Nintendo pads). Retail Skate 3
only knew Xbox 360 pads, so the game's own prompts stay Xbox; a mod can use
`face_labels` for its own UI.

`sdk.graphs.read("action"|"motion")` reads the live controller.
`sdk.graphs.set_enabled(graph, "state"|"transition"|"behavior", id, bool|nil)`
sets or restores an eligibility gate. It does not force a state jump, bypass
native conditions, inject callbacks, or guarantee an immediate exit from an
already-active state. Use `commands.request` with `kind="graph_gate"` when the
mod needs an explicit rejection result. Native graph execution still owns state
entry/exit and behavior lifecycle.

## Bundled examples and remaining boundaries

Broken Bones selects physical limb joints using observed names/topology and
requires both closing speed and impulse. It releases angular limits and limb
drives, keeps linear anchors, reports success only after a receipt, and provides
a Heal action. Injury state is published through generic mod network state; the
existing native pose stream carries the resulting physical pose. Peers must run
the mod to display injury summaries. It does not simulate fractures medically,
detach meshes, or add blood rendering.

Simon Says uses confirmed settlement metadata (`landed_trick_base`,
`landed_spin_degrees`, `landed_clean`, `landed_sketchy`) and explicit round
baselines. Wipeout uses persistent kinematic solids and actual collider overlaps.

The API now provides these concrete lower-level interfaces, not arbitrary access
to every Rust resource. Arbitrary animation blending/pose injection, scoring
collector replacement, raw graph operation replacement, native topology creation,
and direct mutation of another peer's native joints remain unexposed. New needs
should extend these engine interfaces rather than adding mod-specific functions.

Contact lifecycle refers to force-bearing native solver reports: an end means no positive normal response was reported for that pair. It is not proof that the collider shapes have geometrically separated.
