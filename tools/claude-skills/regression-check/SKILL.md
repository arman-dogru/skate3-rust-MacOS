# Regression check

Run the sections that match what changed; when in doubt, run all. Report each result plainly (pass / fail / not
run); don't claim "fixed" from partial checks.

Why this exists: a spawn-rule change for the skate parks once silently moved the **city** maps' startup spawns
underground, making the map look invisible. It passed unit tests and `--check-assets`; only comparing every map's
spawn against a baseline would have caught it.

The check scripts named below (`check_spawns.py`, `check_maps.py`, `check_customiser.py`, `smoke_maps.sh`) are in
`tools/regression-checks/` of upstream PR #37 ("Tools: published research and regression helpers"); fetch that
branch if it is not merged yet. Their baselines are made from YOUR install on the first run (`--update`), so they
never ship game data.

## 1. Converter / asset-pipeline changes (anything under `tools/`)
1. Unit tests: `py -3.13 -m unittest tools.asset_pipeline.test_map_writer tools.asset_pipeline.test_versions
   tools.test_setup_assets tools.test_setup_refresh` (plus `tools.asset_pipeline.test_setup_recovery` where present).
2. Which groups will rebuild: `changed_groups(installed(Path('data'))[1]['pipelines'], fingerprints())` (skill
   `asset-setup`). Make sure that's what you expect.
3. After the refresh: re-point `assets\` to the new id in `data\installation.json`.
4. **Every map, not just the one you changed:**
   - `check_spawns.py`: baked spawns vs the spawn baseline. Any `CHANGED` must be explained and intended; then
     `--update`.
   - `check_maps.py`: ONE `skate3rust --validate-maps` process checks TEST_WORLD + every map in seconds: fails on
     errors, on any warning (spawn support, neutral-startup settle, invisible collision floor) and on any change in
     loaded collision triangles vs the collision baseline. Falls back to `--check-assets` per map on an older exe.
     Run it after ANY collision/loader/converter/physics change; a count change on a map you didn't mean to touch
     is a regression. `--update` accepts intended changes.
   - `summary(install)` from `tools.asset_pipeline.optional_content`: expect 0 warnings (all roster characters).
5. If spawns or collision changed: load the affected maps AND one city map in game (startup uses the baked spawn;
   the saved default map is in repo-root `settings\default-map.json`).

## 2. Game code / input changes (`crates/`)
1. `cargo test -p skate-game --release --bin skate3rust -- <module>::` for touched modules (input: `input::`), plus
   `cargo test -p skate-core --release` if core changed. ALWAYS also compile the full test target
   (`cargo test -p skate-game --release --bin skate3rust --no-run`): a normal build passes while tests that construct
   structs literally fail on a new field.
   Know the pre-existing upstream failures (section 3c) so you can tell them from new ones.
2. Build + stage: `scripts\Build.ps1` (skill `build-and-run`).
3. Smoke test (about 20 s window): launch `bin\skate3rust.exe --assets <repo>\assets` with logs redirected; grep for
   `panic`, `ERROR`, `Controller`, `SKATE_RENDER_READY`, `physics_failed:true`.
   - Input: expect `Controller input: SDL <version>`, `Controller 0: SDL gamepad "<name>" ...`, then
     `Controller 0: ready`.
   - Rendering: `SKATE_RENDER_READY draws=... triangles=...` should match the map's `render_triangles`.

### 2b. Water (physics/water.rs, camera/water.rs, water_splash.rs, board_world water code)
- Headless traces (ignored test, prints per-tick body/board/camera):
  `SKATE3_ASSET_ROOT=<repo>\assets SKATE3_WATER_MAP=<installation>\maps\University.skate
  SKATE3_WATER_DROP=340.3,69.94,-294.3 cargo test --locked -p skate-game --release --bin skate3rust -- --ignored
  --nocapture water_drop`
  Expect: University channel (shallow): lowest body part about 67.996 on a 67.94 surface, calm (settled mean part
  speed about 0.06 m/s), board on the surface. DownTown Aletown canal (`SKATE3_WATER_DROP=-182.3,10.93,465.9`,
  DownTown map, deep): body floats (parts about 8.5-9.0 vs 8.93), board about 8.91, camera about 3 m above. Extra
  env: `SKATE3_WATER_NEAR=x,z,r`, `SKATE3_WATER_SCAN=1`, `SKATE3_WATER_DEPTH_MAP=1`. Build env paths with forward
  slashes in bash.
- Retail reference: shallow water is solid (lie on it); deep water floats; the board floats; water camera high and
  behind with a vignette; splash only in deep water.
- Judge penetration by skeleton parts 1..23: part 0 ("root") does not collide.

### 2c. Audio (game_audio/, skate-audio, audio_*.py; audio branches)
- `cargo test -p skate-audio --release --locked` and `cargo test -p skate-game --release --bin skate3rust --
  game_audio` (plus `graphics_menu`, `modding::audio` if settings/listener changed).
- `py -3.13 -m unittest tools.asset_pipeline.test_audio_formats tools.asset_pipeline.test_versions
  tools.test_setup_assets`.
- Muted smoke run (`bin\skate3rust.exe --assets assets --mute`): the `Game audio: native ...` start lines, no
  `panic`, `ERROR` or missing-file warnings.
- Fingerprints (section 3d): an audio change must change only the `audio` group; never the customiser.
- Physics must be untouched: audio observation code is observation-only; when in doubt run `check_maps.py`
  (identical results).
- Sound quality itself is judged by people listening in game (skill `audio-tuning`), never by an agent.
- Audio MODDING changes: the automated in-game check (skill `audio-autotest`).

## 3. Native dependency / build-script changes
- Build both link configurations (skill `vendor-patch`): dev `cargo build -p skate-game --bin skate3rust --release`
  and release-style `+crt-static --no-default-features --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- `llvm-readobj --coff-imports` on the static exe: no `vcruntime140.dll` / `api-ms-win-crt-*`.
- `--locked` must work (lockfile updated after `[patch]` edits).

## 3b. Performance changes must be behaviour-preserving
Optimisations that silently change behaviour are regressions. For any speed-up (details: skill `optimisation`):
1. Capture a behavioural baseline BEFORE the change, for example full `--validate-maps` results per map (collision
   triangles, support_drop, grounded_ticks, warnings; drop `seconds`/`timings`) to JSON.
2. Keep the old implementation as a test-only reference and compare old vs new on synthetic edge cases AND on the
   real private data (ignored test with `SKATE3_ASSET_ROOT`).
3. After the change, diff the same JSON: it must be identical.
4. Watch for hidden state: caches keyed by path go stale (custom difficulty overlays collections at runtime); reset
   caches on every mutation.

Ready-made behavioural comparisons:
- Maps: `check_maps.py` (validator results + collision baseline) and `check_spawns.py`.
- Character customiser: `check_customiser.py --save` BEFORE the change (snapshots receipts of all output files +
  JSON), then `check_customiser.py` after a fresh setup; set-id-aware, must print IDENTICAL. Needed because a fresh
  setup deletes the previous installation.
- Parallel customiser stages fall back to serial when a worker fails, so the output still matches but the speed-up
  is gone. Check the setup log for `Customiser worker N failed`; there should be none.
- Map conversion: convert all districts with `main`'s tools (`git archive main tools` into a temp folder) and with
  the new tree into the same scratch stage, hash every output (map, irradiance, props) and require IDENTICAL per
  district.
- Stream decoding: `tools/setup-equivalence/compare_streams.py <reference skate3_streams.py>` (PR #37): every asset
  of every district/stream vs a reference copy of the loader (`git show HEAD:...skate3_streams.py > .local/ref.py`).

## 3d. Fingerprint impact (do this for EVERY tools/ change)
- Compare against the COMMITTED tree, never only your local install (it may already contain your edit):
  `git archive HEAD tools` -> temp dir; compare `versions.fingerprints()`, `customiser_setup.fingerprint(old_tools)`
  and `customiser_cache.versions(old_tools)` with the working tree.
- Asset groups: equivalence pairs `[committed, final]` in `pipeline-equivalence.json` only for groups whose outputs
  are proven identical.
- Customiser: has NO equivalence mechanism; its fingerprint/stage versions must not change unless outputs really
  change. `optional_content.py`, `setup_state.py`, `vlt.py`, `environment.py`, `owned_game/**`, `vendor/utt/**`,
  `customis*.py`, `native_roster.py`, `character_glb.py`, `mixamo_to_skate/*.py` are in it: wrap instead of editing
  where possible.
- Fingerprint-free places: `install.py` bodies except `extract`/`convert_map` (and no new top-level imports),
  `tools/setup.py`, new modules whose names match no glob (not `map*`, `character*`, `customis*`, ...).

## 3c. Is a failing test mine or upstream's?
Run it on untouched upstream in a throwaway worktree (separate target dir), never by editing tests:
```powershell
git worktree add -q .local\upstream-check <upstream main commit>
# bash, from inside it:  cargo test --locked -p <crate> --release --target-dir ../upstream-target -- <names>
git worktree remove --force .local\upstream-check; git worktree prune   # from the MAIN checkout (cwd inside = Permission denied)
```
Keep a list of known pre-existing upstream failures with your work notes.

## 4. Reading a play session's log
Latest log: `logs\game-*.stderr.log` (strip ANSI: `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'`).
- Falling from spawn: `requested:PhysicsGround->PhysicsAir` about 9 ticks after `player teleport spawn`, never
  landing; respawn `Teleporting` loops to the same point.
- Under the map: spawn y below the street level of a city (the baseline check catches it); world "invisible",
  collision present.
- Physics blow-ups: `physics_failed:true`, `NONFINITE`, `Non-finite`.

Record new facts and baseline updates in your notes file.
