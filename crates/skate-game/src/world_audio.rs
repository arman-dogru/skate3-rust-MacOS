//! **Hooking up world audio** (engine-facing surface; doc `docs/hails-additions/15-world-audio.md`).
//!
//! The game has no living world yet (no traffic, pedestrians or AI skaters). Retail's audio for
//! them is ported (`skate_audio::world`, hosted by `game_audio::{world_sources, npc_skaters}`) and
//! waits for publishers. A future engine system (or a Lua mod, `sdk.world_audio`) only adds
//! components to its own entities and sends a few messages; it never sees AEMS, MixMap keys,
//! packets or banks:
//!
//! - a vehicle: [`TrafficAudio`] (engine record name, horn, skid; speed / acceleration optional);
//! - a pedestrian: [`PedAudio`] (voice, shoe class, foot plants, materials, speech value);
//! - an NPC (AI) skater or a remote multiplayer player: [`NpcSkaterAudio`] with an
//!   [`AudioState`] filled like the local player's (`skate_events::skater_audio_state` for a
//!   skater simulated with the player's physics, [`AudioState::rolling`] for anything else);
//! - optional [`AudioVelocity`] for objects that teleport or are kinematic proxies (Doppler and
//!   the 3-D rates read the velocity; by default it is the transform's change per frame).
//!
//! Position and heading come from the entity's `GlobalTransform` (heading = its +Z axis, the
//! game's forward; retail's vehicle `+112` is the world matrix's forward row, recomp gap run G1).
//! **Lifetime = the entity:** insert the component to publish, despawn or remove it to release.
//! Ids are `Entity::to_bits()`, so a reused index is a new owner.
//!
//! **The audio decides who is audible** with retail's limits, applied by the hosts: the 4 nearest
//! vehicles within 40 m (horizontal), the 15 nearest peds within 50 m (footsteps for the 3
//! nearest), one NPC skater within 30 m of the camera (the first in list order, held until 30 m).
//! The opt-in non-retail "more audible" setting raises these to 8 / 24 / 3. The bridge inserts
//! [`WorldAudioInstance`] on the entities that hold an instance, so an engine system can skip
//! per-frame audio work (an NPC's `AudioState`) for the others.
//!
//! Messages: [`PedSpeechEvent`] (a state graph's `SendSpeechEvent`), [`PedTazerEvent`] (a zap:
//! the tazer burst), [`PedBodyFallEvent`] (a knock-down animation's `BodyFallType` key),
//! [`NpcSkaterReactionEvent`] (an NPC skater saw a slam / trick or crashed: its own speech),
//! [`VehicleHorn`] (hold a horn kind for the caller's time), [`VehicleAlarm`] (retail's 8 s alarm),
//! [`VehicleImpact`] (something touched a vehicle: retail's car alarm rule sets a [`VehicleParked`]
//! car's alarm off, tuned by [`CarAlarmRule`], observed through [`VehicleAlarmStarted`]),
//! [`AnnouncerSpeechEvent`] (the announcer channel: a challenge's commentary; set
//! [`LivingWorldAudio::announcer`] while a challenge with an announcer runs). Set [`LivingWorldAudio`]
//! `expected` at map load when the system will publish, so the world banks decode ahead of need.
//!
//! Everything stays inert when nothing is published. `SKATE_AEMS_WORLD=0` /
//! `SKATE_AEMS_NPC_SKATERS=0` turn the hosts off.
// An API for systems the engine does not have yet: not every item has a caller in the game.
