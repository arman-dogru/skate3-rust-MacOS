# 21 — Low camera: the retail "Camera Angle" setting (upstream issue #3)

Branch: `feature/low-camera` (from `main` 4488651). Upstream issue: SK8-ENGINE/skate-3-rust-engine#3, requested by
@HittaJP ("In the original Skate 3 there is a 'Low' camera angle setting ... It seems like the camera angle is the
'High' option from Skate 3 with no way to change it.").

## Problem

The engine always plays the High camera. `physics/camera_output.rs` passed a constant `camera_type: 1` to the stock
camera graph, so there was no way to get Skate 3's Low camera.

## What retail does

Reference: the TU3 build through skate3recomp (by @mchughalex, built on the rexglue SDK), the converted disc data and the
game's string tables. Addresses are TU3.

- **The option.** Game Settings has a selector row `ID_GAMESETTINGS_CAMERA_ANGLE_TOGGLE`, shown as **"Camera Angle"**,
  with the values `ID_GAMESETTINGS_CAMERA_HIGH` / `ID_GAMESETTINGS_CAMERA_LOW` (**"High"** / **"Low"**). It is option
  index 11 of the Game Settings option table (`0x83026EC8`, name + widget type pairs; the camera row is a
  `selector`). In the English string table it sits with the control options ("Inverted / Normal", "Cameraman Mode",
  "Camera Angle", "High", "Low", "Control Settings").
- **First boot.** The boot flow asks for it: "Choose your camera:" (`ID_BOOTFLOW_CHOOSECAMERA`) with two preview movies,
  `data/movies/cameraLow_english_ntsc.vp6` and `cameraHigh_english_ntsc.vp6` (played by `sub_82609F30`, argument 0 =
  Low). So a retail profile has no silent default; the player picks one.
- **Where the value lives.** The camera preferences object `*(0x83085450)`, built by `82DF61F0`, holds the camera type
  at +20 (the constructor writes 0). The same object holds the look-inversion bytes +24/+25 and the air bytes +36..+38
  that our `CameraPreferences` already models.
- **What reads it.** Only the camera graph condition `IsCameraTypeActive` (registered by `82F93718`, factory
  `82DFBE18` stores the authored `type` at +28, evaluate `82DF4F70` returns `type == [prefs + 20]`).
- **What it changes.** The stock graph `data/script/camera/Default_cameragraph` (a setup asset):
  `CameraLow` = `IsCameraTypeActive type=0` **or** `IsInObserverMode` → `cameragraph_low.xml`; `CameraHigh` =
  `IsCameraTypeActive type=1` → `cameragraph_high.xml`. The two sub-graphs pick different stock shots from the
  `camera_shots` collection (also setup data): riding `bl_chase` vs `bl_high_chase`, grinding `bl_grind` (+ ledge left /
  right) vs `high_grind` (+ left / right), manual `bl_manual` vs `high_manual`, air `bl_air` vs `bl_high_air`, skitching
  `bl_skitching` vs `bl_high_skitching`; the low graph also has road, race, turning and security shots the high graph
  doesn't use. Wipeouts, drop-in, offboard, hippy jumps, plants and re-entry use the same shots in both. The rig
  settings (`camera` dynamics, trackers, positioner, compass) are shared; only the shots differ.

Representative shot values (`camera_shots`, inherited fields resolved; distance m, angles degrees):

| shot | camera | distance | elevation | framing pitch | board offset | lens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `chase_flat_slow` | Low (in `bl_chase`) | 1.8 | 7 | −4 | 0.9 | 12 |
| `chase_flat_fast` | Low | 2.5 | 5 | −2 | 0.9 | 12 |
| `chase_up_slow` | Low | 2.1 | −5 | −10 | 0.9 | 12 |
| `high_chase` | High (in `bl_high_chase`) | 3.0 | 30 | 3 | 1.0 | 12 |
| `high_chase2` | High | 4.4 | 26.6 | 5 | 1.0 | 12 |
| `grind_flat_slow` | Low | 1.5 | 7 | −10 | 0.6 | 12 |
| `high_grind` | High | 2.9 | 17 | 5 | 1.0 | 12 |
| `far_manual` / `close_manual` | Low | 2.35 / 1.1 | 13 / −5 | −2 / −8 | 0.9 / 0.5 | 12 |
| `high_manual` | High | 2.25 | 19 | 0 | 1.0 | 12 |

So Low is closer (about 1.5–2.5 m instead of 3–4.4 m), nearly level with the board (−5..+7° instead of 17–30°) and
looks slightly up; the field of view (lens 12) is the same.

### Measurement in the recomp

A short muted scripted run of the recomp (`.local/research/low-camera/`, watch list `cam_watch.txt`:
`0x83085450 @ +20`) read the camera type once a second from boot through gameplay and the Career menu: **0 (Low)** in
every sample with the local save, which matches a profile set to Low. Driving the Career menu by script to flip the
option did not work (only the first menu input of a run registered, twice), so the write itself was not observed; no
static writer of +20 was found either (the value presumably arrives with the profile's settings block).

## Change

- `camera/angle.rs` (new): `CameraAngle` (`Low` = graph type 0, `High` = 1) and the resource `CameraAngleSettings`
  (the player's choice, saved in the installation's `settings/camera.json` next to `graphics.json`, as `{"angle": "low" | "high"}`; a mod's forced angle; mod shot
  tunings). `active()` is what the camera uses. `sync_runtime` (PreUpdate, after the pause menu) copies the active
  type and the tunings into `CameraRuntime` every frame, so a map reload, which rebuilds the runtime, keeps them.
- `physics/camera_output.rs`: `camera_type` comes from `CameraRuntime::camera_type()` instead of the constant 1.
- `camera/runtime.rs`: `camera_type` / `set_camera_type`, `has_shot`, `set_shot_tunings` (re-selects the current shot
  once so a tuned shot in use updates through the normal shot transition).
- `camera/shot_data.rs`: a tuning layer over the stock shots, applied when a shot is loaded (also inside blend trees).
- Pause menu (`graphics_menu.rs`): **SKATER > Camera angle High / Low** (Left / Right / A), saved at once. Switching
  live is safe: the graph re-evaluates its priority states on the next tick and blends to the other branch's shot.
- Default: **High**, the engine's behaviour so far. Retail has no silent default (the boot flow asks), so no shipped
  value exists to copy; the retail constructor's 0 (Low) is overwritten by the player's choice before play.

### Mod surface (Lua API 2, `sdk.capabilities.camera` = 4)

- `sdk.camera.angle()` → `{selected, active, owner, shot, tuned}` (also `sdk.snapshot.camera_angle`): the player's
  setting, what the graph uses, the mod forcing it, the current stock shot and the tuned shots with their owners.
- `sdk.camera.set_angle("low" | "high" | nil)`: force the angle; nil hands it back to the player. One mod at a time.
- `sdk.camera.tune_shot(shot, patch | nil)`: replace stock values of one shot by retail attribute name and unit —
  `PositionDistance`, `PositionElevation`, `PositionHeading`, `FramingLensLength`, `FramingRoll` / `Yaw` / `Pitch`,
  `ReferenceBoardOffset`, `SmoothingDirection` / `Elevation` / `Yaw` / `Pitch`, `TransitionTime`. Unknown names, out of
  range values and unknown shots fail the command. One mod per shot.
- Everything a mod set is released when it is disabled, fails, or the mod runtime resets (`clear_owner` in all four
  cleanup paths of `modding/mod.rs`). The player's saved setting is never changed by a mod.

Engine-facing: other systems read `Res<CameraAngleSettings>` (`active()`, `selected`, `forced_by()`) or
`CameraRuntime::camera_type()`.

## Verification

Runs (2026-10-04, Windows, release):
- `cargo test --locked --release -p skate-mods --lib`: 59 passed (the `skyline_physics` integration test needs the
  Skyline GLB, which a fresh checkout doesn't have).
- `cargo test --locked --release -p skate-game --bin skate3rust`: 314 passed, 2 failed, both pre-existing
  (`pipelines_accept_valid_group_outputs_when_fingerprint_changes`, `sky_shader_validates`).
- Asset-backed `-- --ignored camera`: 4 passed, including the new test (standing camera height: High 1.85 m, Low
  0.59 m, back to High 1.84 m after the high shot's slow elevation smoothing settles).
- In game (University, muted capture): `settings/camera.json` = low → log `Camera angle: Low`, no errors,
  `physics_failed:false`.

Tests:
- `camera::angle::tests` (graph type mapping, saved setting round trip and bad values, mod force / release / disable,
  tuning ownership and generation), `camera::shot_data::tests::tuning_replaces_only_named_fields_in_retail_units`,
  `graphics_menu::tests::sections_expose_only_real_rows_and_all_maps` (the new row).
- skate-mods: `presentation::tests::camera_shot_tuning_uses_retail_names_and_rejects_bad_values`,
  `vm::driving_extension_tests::camera_angle_api_crosses_the_lua_boundary` (real Lua → commands, rejected input).
- Asset-backed (`--ignored`, `SKATE3_ASSET_ROOT`): `camera_angle_switches_between_the_stock_low_and_high_graphs` — a
  standing skater through the real stock graph gets `bl_high_chase`, then `bl_chase` after switching to Low (camera
  lower), a mod tuning reload keeps `bl_chase`, and High returns to the same height.
- In game (@Hailey-Ross, 2026-10-04), riding with Low selected: "just tried out the low camera build and it looks
  great!" Default decided: "default should be high".

## Open questions

- The retail writer of `prefs + 20` and the value a fresh profile stores before the boot-flow choice were not found
  (static search and two scripted menu runs). The engine keeps High as its default (decided 2026-10-04: "default should
  be high").
- The first-boot "Choose your camera" screen (with the two preview movies) is not ported; the menu row covers the
  setting.
- `IsInObserverMode` also forces the low graph in retail; our condition maps it to the subject's special-effect flag
  (unchanged by this work).
