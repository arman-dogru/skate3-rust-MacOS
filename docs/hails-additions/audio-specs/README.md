# Audio specs

Behavioural specifications behind the native audio port ([doc 11](../11-audio.md)) and the world audio
hook-in ([doc 15](../15-world-audio.md)). Code comments in `crates/skate-audio` and
`crates/skate-game/src/game_audio` cite them as `audio-specs/<name>.md §n`; the section numbers are kept
stable for that reason.

## What these are

- Written in our own words from reading the Skate 3 TU 3.0.3.0 recompilation, the disc data and the
  attribute database, then checked against traces of the running recompilation. Function addresses
  (`sub_8xxxxxxx`), object offsets and image constants are given as references so a reader can find the same
  code; no game code or game data is copied here.
- Measured values (levels, rates, timings, counts) come from the recompilation unless a line says otherwise.
  The recompilation is not the console: its frame rate, timing and threading differ, so its program logic is
  the strong evidence and its timings are weaker.
- Upstream PR #4 and PR #1 (@andrewnakas) and the other prior work were read for behaviour only; see
  [`rwaudio-prior-work.md`](rwaudio-prior-work.md) and the credit tables in the specs.
- These are working notes. Tags such as **[R]** (our reading of the code), **[IMG]** (image constant),
  **[TR]** / **[T]** (trace-checked), **[I]** (inference) and **UNCERTAIN** say how firm each statement is.
  Later findings are added as dated sections; superseded text is marked rather than removed.
- Session names (`all_20261002_164620`, `state_20261003_084712.tsv`, …) are labels of recordings made
  during the work; the recordings themselves are local and not published. Scripts named as "local" are not
  published either; the published ones are under [`tools/`](../../../tools/README.md) (doc 14).
