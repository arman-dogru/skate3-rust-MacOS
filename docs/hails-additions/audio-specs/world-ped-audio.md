# Pedestrian audio — retail spec, port state, hook points (2026-10-03)

Port: `crates/skate-audio/src/world/peds.rs`. Host: `game_audio/world_sources.rs`. Harness: `tests/world_sources.rs`
(`a_ped_walks_past_and_steps_on_each_plant`). Speech is in `world-speech.md`.
The MixMap Pedestrian slot (5) has 15 instances. Objects: PedestrianSpeech (5.0), PedestrianSFX (5.1), PedBodyFall (5.2), Tazer (5.3).
Every B lookup reads Ctl 5.1, the ped's 3DObjPos.

## Ped record the objects read
- **Audio state `[object+32]`:**
  - +52 = active.
  - +68 = footsteps on. Who sets it is not traced; probably distance or visibility.
  - +73 = foot B down, +74 = foot A down.
  - +96 = kind (64 → the close-range outputs).
  - +116 = speech target.
  - +132 = shoe class 1..5 → footstep w14.
  - +136 = the speech value last sent by the state graph (`SendSpeechEvent`).
  - +140 / +144 = materials A / B (143 = none → 3).
  - +148 / +156 = the speech flag pair.
- **Owner `[object+28]`:** +128 = speed, +144 = 1..5 → footstep w16 (weight?).

## PedestrianSFX (vtable `0x822FCCC8`, factory `sub_824D7E00`)
- **Process `sub_824D8078`:**
  - +416 = trunc(curve(speed)), using the OffBoard-tuning curve `90B47430C4ED2CCC` (not the player's walk curve).
  - Copy the feet into +52/+236 and zero +53/+237.
  - If footsteps are on:
    1. Poster `sub_824D81F8`. Post two `livingword_footstep` packets (B first) through `sub_824B77F0`(foot 0 / 1000, +416, eEQChain
       `A9023782094771B5` + 10): `[32767,0,4096,foot,25000,0×8,speed,1,1,1,0,0,0,eq]`.
    2. Steps `sub_824D8320`. On a foot's rising edge: stop that foot's last Splice sound and start `sk8_foley` (bank 7)
       id = run 64 if speed > 7.5, jog 63 if > 2.5, else walk 62. The Clothing thresholds and OffBoard ids are the
       same fields as the player's walking voices. Block = [0,1,0,dt,0,1].
    3. `sub_824D8E60`: a one-shot +412 flag by camera distance. Not ported, because nothing the footsteps read uses it.
  - Finally copy this frame's foot flags into +54/+238.
- **Update `sub_824D81A8`:**
  - `sub_824D8658` (if footsteps on) rewrites both packets:

    | word | value |
    |---|---|
    | w1 | raw 0 |
    | w2 | pitch 5 (≤ 8192) |
    | w4 / w5 | filters 7 / 8 (≤ 25001) |
    | w6 | level 9 |
    | w7 | level 1, or 2 when kind = 64 |
    | w8 | foot down |
    | w9 | +53 (always 0 from process) |
    | w10 | speech value ∈ {4,5} (jump) |
    | w12 | speech value ∈ {6,7} (collision) |
    | w13 | +416 |
    | w14 | class |
    | w15 | footstep surface(material), 1..7 (AudioSurfaceMap word 6) |
    | w16 | weight |
    | w17..19 | OffBoard `62A2E642…` = 32767 / 7000 / 25000 |

  - `sub_824D84D0`: the Splice steps follow block = [level(4 if kind 64 else 3)/32767, pitch 5/4096, raw 0·360/65535,
    dt, 0, 1], and a step that has ended is freed.
- **Bank behaviour** (harness and `program_trace` sweeps):
  - The program plays a step on w8's rising edge.
  - **w14 = 1 is silent.** Classes 2..5 each have their own shoe sample set: 2 → 0–4 / 19–24 / 112–116, 3 → 5–9 / 25–30 /
    43–50 / 118–133, 4 → 10–14 / 31–36 / 66–69, 5 → 15–18 / 37–42 / 70–74. Surface layers are 51–60.
  - **4,798 of retail's 4,949 `fstep_livingworld` starts (97 %, session 164620) fall in these groups.** Retail used
    classes 2, 4 and 5 that session. The other 151 starts (slots 78–100, 117) need word states we have not driven:
    w9 / w11 / jump / collision combinations.
- In the harness, a ped at 4 m walking 1.3 m/s gives a step per plant, AEMS voice gains 0.02–0.17 and sk8_foley 0.22–0.28.
  Retail fstep_livingworld GAIN×SEND is 0.000 p50 / 0.024 p90 over all distances.

## PedestrianSpeech (vtable `0x822FBF40`): `world-speech.md`

## Not ported yet
- **PedBodyFall:** `Bodyslide`-like falls when a ped is knocked down. Not decoded.
- **Tazer** (`Tazer.abk`, `c_tazer` + `c_tazer_grn_play`): uses AEMS op 38 ControlClass, which the evaluator has not ported.
  Retail had 49 starts in 164620.
- **Ped hand props, ATM / vending machine sounds:** the plugins' own objects. Not looked at.

## Waiting on the engine
1. **A ped system** (census spawns, state graphs; `npc-livingworld-re.md`). Per ped it fills
   `WorldOwners.peds[id]` with a `PedState`:
   - position, velocity and speed;
   - **foot plants** from the walk animation;
   - materials under the feet;
   - shoe class (from the model; 1 = silent);
   - weight;
   - speech value (the state graph's `SendSpeechEvent` on each state entry);
   - footsteps on (near the camera).
2. Speech voice id per ped model (for the speech index).

## Open
- **2026-10-03, gap run G2 (`world-audio-hookin-spec.md` §7.3): settled** +68 (the 3 nearest of a nearest-first
  50 m list, manager `sub_824F2890`), +148 / +156 (listener distance / the model's 20 m far threshold), and the
  per-model class / kind / voice (`aud_characteristics`, model = voice id). `[obj+28]+144` is dynamic, not a weight.
- Which model → class / weight / kind / voice. These are probably `livingworld_models` fields; find their readers.
- What sets +68 (footsteps on) and +148 / +156.
- The `sub_824D8E60` flag.
- The 3 % of retail slots we do not produce (above).
- Instance assignment: nearest 15, provisional.

## Tazer and PedBodyFall ported (2026-10-03, doc 15 "Gaps closed")
- **SFXObj_Tazer** (object 5.3, vtable `0x822FCB60`, factory `sub_824F12D0`, 40 bytes): process `sub_824F1478`
  (gate `[obj+16]+52`): while the ped audio state's byte `S+80` (= the manager's bit 17 of entry `+4`) is set and
  no packet is held, post `c_tazer` (`sub_824B7950`, class descriptor `0x8302EEF8`, 9 words
  `[32767, 0, 4096, 0, 25000, 0, 0, 0, G+4 byte]`, G = `*(0x83083C38)+0x2F070`, 0 in free skate); when it clears,
  release. Update `sub_824F1560`: w1 raw0, w2 pitch1 (≤ 8192), w6 level3, w7 level2. The program owns a child post
  (`c_tazer_grn_play`, op 38) and plays the burst while held: samples 8, 7, then shuffles of 0–6.
  - `S+80` = tazing: the post comes 22 ms after the state graph's `TazeEntity` entry (PEDTIMER `TazerCycTime`
    2.0 s, `pedestrian_wanttotaze.xml`), 3 / 3 zaps of 164620; bursts 2 / 3 last 2.1 / 2.0 s (the hold); burst 1
    ended after 1.33 s (cause not traced).
  - **Check** (`tazer_bursts_follow_the_recomp`, the export of a local research tool): ours 19 starts per 2 s hold vs the
    recomp's 10 / 20 / 19 (49); gaps 192 / 192 / 128 / 96… vs 190 / 190 / 130 / 90–100, the 11th gap 128 vs 129 /
    131; first-start gain recomp / ours 0.85 / 0.93 / 1.00 at the recorded geometry; order 8, 7, shuffles.
- **SFXObj_PedBodyFall** (object 5.2, vtable `0x822FCB18`, factory `sub_824F0880`): process `sub_824F0AB8`:
  `S+76` (float, = entry `+16`) is the ped animation's **`BodyFallType`** channel (the string sits with
  `RightToeDown` / `LeftToeDown` in the animation-event table at `0x820648F8`). On a change to a non-zero value one
  Skate_Collisions sound starts through `sub_82497F48` (mono submix on eEQChain bus `[holder +140 field
  B4C4F86A53963BA2]` = absent → 0, create): 8 → container 1184 (2 round-robin slots `+40/+44`, index `+60`),
  9 → 948 (`+48/+52`, `+64`), other → 1183 (`+56`); containers from class `923CCB46EF5BF5BA` record
  `DFEFC9212E0CBD2C` (holder `+124`). Update `sub_824F0E50`: per type its own volume / pitch output (8: out1 / out2,
  9: out3 / out4, other: out5 / out6), raw0 azimuth, dt, env send level(7) (`sub_82498140`).
  - **The recordings DO show it** (the earlier "no post" looked at POST lines; the starts are SPLC with chain
    `82497FAC<824F0BE8|824F0D10|824F0E0C`): 75 starts in 6 sessions, the knock-down patterns 9, +0.10 other, +0.48 9,
    +0.16 9 and 9, +0.13 8, +0.07 8, +0.10 other, +0.38 9 and 9, +0.15 other.
  - **Check** (`body_falls_follow_the_recomp`, 73 starts with sample resolution): container 73 / 73 by type; the
    recomp's sample is one the container plays in 57; voice gain recomp / ours p50 0.79 (p10 0.25, p90 1.25, n 40;
    the knocked-down ped is guessed = the ped nearest the player).
- Engine: `PedAudio::{tazing, body_fall}`, messages `PedTazerEvent { seconds }` (default `ped_objects.tazer_seconds`
  = TazerCycTime) and `PedBodyFallEvent { kind }` (queued, one console frame on, one off). Mod: ped option `tazing`,
  events `tazer` / `body_fall`. Setup: `world_tuning.ped_objects` (ids, eq, tazer seconds from the xml).
